## Issues fro ETL
* __FOR NOW THERE IS SOME ISSUE AND THE CUBE DOESN'T PROCCESS!!__
* Dates are showing completely wrong in the views
* Analysis Services block just doesn't work - no checkmarks
* SCD2 isn't checked - no idea if it actually works yet
* the agent amount is weird but idk if this is ok or not

## Issues for insert generation
* Cost of Naprawy + Platnosc won't add up to cost of Odszkodowanie cause they are all just randomly generated
* Names in excel are generated seperately from sql, so there is a big chance they just wont match
