# HD_laboratory
Code for labs for HD class

## Issues still in code
* The dates are randomly chosen for every table so sometimes they make no sense in reality (ex. zdarzenie happening after postepowanie is done)
* Cost of Naprawy + Platnosc won't add up to cost of Odszkodowanie cause they are all just randomly generated
* Names in excel are generated seperately from sql, so there is a big chance they just wont match
* the excel is not full for now, cause i don't think we have to do anything with it rn and that would end up being like 5mln rows in each file

* We NEED to add some leaving dates for workers (not all though? ig) beacasue we need them for later labs (make sure the table name matches whatever was written in Lab3 project)
