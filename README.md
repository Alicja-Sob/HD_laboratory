# HD_laboratory
Code for labs for HD class

## Still to do for Lab
* Select queries showing the generated data
  * should it show that excel and db are compatible? 

## Issues still in code
* The dates are randomly chosen for every table so sometimes they make no sense in reality (ex. zdarzenie happening after postepowanie is done)
* Cost of Naprawy + Platnosc won't add up to cost of Odszkodowanie cause they are all just randomly generated
* Names in excel are generated seperately from sql, so there is a big chance they just wont match
