# HD_laboratory
Code for labs for HD class

## Still to do for Lab
* Select queries showing the generated data
  * should it show that excel and db are compatible? 

## Issues still in code
* Updates for Odwolanie dont work? for some reason? they seem to generate fine, but just don't update idk
* The dates are randomly chosen for every table so sometimes they make no sense in reality (ex. zdarzenie happening after postepowanie is done)
* Cost of Naprawy + Platnosc won't add up to cost of Odszkodowanie cause they are all just randomly generated
* Names in excel are generated seperately from sql, so there is a big chance they just wont match
* the excel is not full for now, cause i don't think we have to do anything with it rn and that would end up being like 5mln rows in each file
